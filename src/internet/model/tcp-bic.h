/** \brief BIC congestion control algorithm
 *
 * In TCP Bic the congestion control problem is viewed as a search
 * problem. Taking as a starting point the current window value
 * and as a target point the last maximum window value
 * (i.e. the cWnd value just before the loss event) a binary search
 * technique can be used to update the cWnd value at the midpoint between
 * the two, directly or using an additive increase strategy if the distance from
 * the current window is too large.
 *
 * This way, assuming a no-loss period, the congestion window logarithmically
 * approaches the maximum value of cWnd until the difference between it and cWnd
 * falls below a preset threshold. After reaching such a value (or the maximum
 * window is unknown, i.e. the binary search does not start at all) the algorithm
 * switches to probing the new maximum window with a 'slow start' strategy.
 *
 * If a loss occur in either these phases, the current window (before the loss)
 * can be treated as the new maximum, and the reduced (with a multiplicative
 * decrease factor Beta) window size can be used as the new minimum.
 *
 * To maintain the performance of TCP Bic as close as possible with the Linux
 * implementation, and at the same time maintain the friendliness with other TCP
 * flavors, the cWnd is increased only after a certain number of ACKs
 * are received, following RFC 6356. After the slow start phase, and after each
 * new ACK, a value is calculated by the method Update. This number
 * (m_cnt in the code) represents the ACK packets that should be received
 * before increasing the cWnd by one segment. After a trivial check on the
 * arrived ACKs (represented by m_cWndCnt in the code), the
 * cWnd can be increased and m_cWndCnt can be set to zero, or
 * otherwise m_cWndCnt can be increased by one and the
 * cWnd can be left untouched.
 *
 * The binary search on the cWnd size space is done by varying the returned
 * cnt, depending on the internal state of the class (e.g. the last maximum
 * and the current cWnd size).
 *
 * The reference paper for BIC can be found in:
 * http://an.kaist.ac.kr/courses/2006/cs540/reading/bic-tcp.pdf
 *
 * This model has a number of configurable parameters that are exposed as
 * attributes of the TcpBic TypeId.  This model also exports trace sources,
 * for tracking the congestion window, slow start threshold, and the internat
 * state of the protocol.
 *
 * More information on this implementation: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2756518
